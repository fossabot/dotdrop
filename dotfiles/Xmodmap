# # print screen --> use as another super key, print screen with Mode_switch
# # Note: On GNOME, it appears Super_R doesn't work the same as Super_L
# xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = Super_L NoSymbol Print Sys_Req"

# # left alt --> mode_switch key
# xmodmap -e "keycode 64 = Mode_switch NoSymbol"

# # escape key --> tilde and backtick
# # Note: this can have unexpected consequences if you use `xcape` to map
# # Control/Caps to send Escape when tapped. It will instead send `/~ when you
# # press Caps Lock attempting to get Escape.
# # A solution might be to switch the keys around and use a non-op key as a
# # placeholder, like in the xcape README
# # https://github.com/alols/xcape/blob/master/README.md#examples
# xmodmap -e "keycode 9 = grave asciitilde grave asciitilde"

# # backspace --> delete, and
# # mode_switch + backspace --> home
# xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = Delete NoSymbol Home"

# # mode_switch + delete --> end
# # Note: This won't work when combined with `xbindkeys`, since `xbindkeys`
# # hijacks the entire Delete key from X.
# xmodmap -e "keycode 119 = Delete NoSymbol End"

# mode_switch + h, j, k, l --> additional arrow keys
# Bonus: capital J/K are Page Down/Up, H/L are Home/End with Mode_switch + Shift
# xmodmap -e "keycode 43 = h H Left Home"
# xmodmap -e "keycode 44 = j J Down Next"
# xmodmap -e "keycode 45 = k K Up Prior"
# xmodmap -e "keycode 46 = l L Right End"
